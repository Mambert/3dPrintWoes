For my first printer I selected the Ender 3 V3 KE for its offline capability (Wifi is shotty) and other benefits. (Ability to accept AI Camera, vibration detection, auto-bed leveling (Which hopefully won't even need to be an addition soon, more so the default.) and live Z offset.)

First mistake I potentially made was not realizing the filament provided was hyper PLA. I have been printing at standard 300mm/s speed, but it's almost a shame to know I could be faster. 

Second mistake: Not tuning supports enough. I first printed out a mini figure from Hero Forge, and I was so excited to see it complete, I didn't really bother tweaking the supports. I should have. The supports were the biggest pain of the build. 
The next build I made was an owl model, and I decided to try tree supports. I should've turned down cura's aggressive supporting, but I found they were much easier to peel off. Tree supports my beloved. 

I have swapped my filament mid-print, and the rest of that print (a simple pen holder) was fine. So I assumed it would behave like the included PLA. 
I had forgotten though that the included filament was hyper PLA. The filament I replaced it with was standard PLA. Hyper PLA prints fine at 300mm/s but the new filament was only rated 40-80mm/s. 
Note: Double check filament print speeds before printing.
